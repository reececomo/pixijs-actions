## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm install pixijs-actions

# yarn
yarn add pixijs-actions
```

## Getting started with Actions

*Create, configure, and run actions in PixiJS.*

You tell nodes to run an instace of `Action` when you want to animate contents of your canvas. When the canvas processes frames of animation, the actions are executed. Some actions are completed in a single frame of animation, while other actions apply changes over multiple frames of animation before completing. The most common use for actions is to animate changes to a nodeâ€™s properties. For example, you can create actions that move a node, scale or rotate it, or fade its transparency. However, actions can also change the node tree or even execute custom code.

## Basic usage

*Create reusable animations &amp; actions, run them on display objects.*

```ts
const razzleDazzle = Action.sequence([
  Action.fadeIn(0.3),
  Action.rotateByDegrees(360, 0.3).easeInOut(),
]);

// âœ¨ Show mySprite with some flair!
mySprite.run(razzleDazzle);
```

## Setup

*Quick start guide for first time setup.*

1. First install the package. The library imports as an ES6 module, and includes TypeScript types.

```sh
# npm
npm install pixijs-actions

# yarn
yarn add pixijs-actions
```

2. Register the DisplayObject mixin:

```ts
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { registerDisplayObjectMixin } from 'pixijs-actions';

registerDisplayObjectMixin(PIXI.DisplayObject);
```

2. Register the `registerDisplayObjectMixin()` mixin and ticker with your PixiJS app (or other render loop):

```ts
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { Action, registerDisplayObjectMixin } from 'pixijs-actions';

// Register the Actions mixin
registerDisplayObjectMixin(PIXI.DisplayObject);

const myApp = new PIXI.Application({ ... });

// Tick actions
myApp.ticker.add(ticker => Action.tick(ticker.deltaTime)); // PixiJS v8
myApp.ticker.add(dt => Action.tick(dt)); // PixiJS v6 + v7
```

Now you can add your first action!

## Action Initializers

*Combine these initializers to create complex animations.*

Most actions implement specific predefined animations that are ready to use. If your animation needs fall outside of the suite provided here, then you should implement a custom action. See **Creating Custom Actions** below.

```ts
import { Action } from 'pixijs-actions';

// âœ¨ Expand and contract smoothly over 2 seconds.
const pulsate = Action.sequence([
  Action.scaleTo(1.5, 1.0).easeOut(),
  Action.scaleTo(1, 1.0).easeIn()
]);

// âœ¨ Follow a complex path (e.g. a bezier curve).
const path = [
  { x: 0, y: 0 },
  { x: 100, y: 0 },
  { x: 100, y: 100 },
  { x: 200, y: 200 }
];
const followPath = Action.follow(path, 5.0);

// âœ¨ Create a 10 second loop.
const moveBackAndForthWhilePulsating = Action.group([
  Action.repeat(pulsate, 5),
  Action.sequence([followPath, followPath.reversed()]),
]);

// âœ¨ Animate continuously.
mySprite.run(Action.repeatForever(moveBackAndForthWhilePulsating));
```

### About Reversing Actions
All actions have a `.reversed()` method which will return an action with the reverse action on it. Some actions are **not reversible**, and these cases are noted in the table above:
- _**â€ Identical:**_ The reversed action will be identical to the original action.
- _**\*No:**_ The reversed action will only idle for the equivalent duration.

## Timing Modes

All actions have a `timingMode` which controls the speed curve of its execution.

The default timingMode for all actions is `TimingMode.linear`, which causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration.

You can customize the speed curve of actions like so:

```ts
// Use the defaults
Action.fadeIn(0.3).easeIn();
Action.fadeIn(0.3).easeOut();
Action.fadeIn(0.3).easeInOut();

// Set a TimingMode
Action.fadeIn(0.3).setTimingMode(TimingMode.easeInOutCubic);

// Provide a custom function
Action.fadeIn(0.3).setTimingMode(x => x * x);
```

### Global Defaults

The `.easeInOut()`, `.easeIn()`, and `.easeOut()` methods set the timing mode of the action to the global default timing for that curve type.

You can set any global defaults for these by updating `Action.DefaultTimingModeEaseInOut`, `Action.DefaultTimingModeEaseIn`, and `Action.DefaultTimingModeEaseOut`. The default timing modes for these easings are `TimingMode.easeInOutSine`, `TimingMode.easeInSine`, and `TimingMode.easeOutSine` respectively.

### Built-in TimingMode Options

See the following table for default `TimingMode` options.

| Pattern | Ease In, Ease Out | Ease In | Ease Out | Description |
| --------------- | ----- | -- | --- | ----------- |
| **Linear**      | `linear` | - | - | Constant motion with no acceleration or deceleration. |
| **Sine**        | `easeInOutSine` | `easeInSine` | `easeOutSine` | Gentle start and end, with accelerated motion in the middle. |
| **Circular**        | `easeInOutCirc` | `easeInCirc` | `easeOutCirc` | Smooth start and end, faster acceleration in the middle, circular motion. |
| **Cubic**       | `easeInOutCubic` | `easeInCubic` | `easeOutCubic` | Gradual acceleration and deceleration, smooth motion throughout. |
| **Quadratic**        | `easeInOutQuad` | `easeInQuad` | `easeOutQuad` | Smooth acceleration and deceleration, starts and ends slowly, faster in the middle. |
| **Quartic**     | `easeInOutQuart` | `easeInQuart` | `easeOutQuart` | Slower start and end, increased acceleration in the middle. |
| **Quintic**     | `easeInOutQuint` | `easeInQuint` | `easeOutQuint` | Very gradual start and end, smoother acceleration in the middle. |
| **Exponential**        | `easeInOutExpo` | `easeInExpo` | `easeOutExpo` | Very slow start, exponential acceleration, slow end. |
| **Back**        | `easeInOutBack` | `easeInBack` | `easeOutBack` | Starts slowly, overshoots slightly, settles into final position. |
| **Bounce**      | `easeInOutBounce` | `easeInBounce` | `easeOutBounce` | Bouncy effect at the start or end, with multiple rebounds. |
| **Elastic**     | `easeInOutElastic` | `easeInElastic` | `easeOutElastic` | Stretchy motion with overshoot and multiple oscillations. |

### Custom Actions

Actions are stateless and reusable, so you can create complex animations once, and then run them on many display objects.

```ts
/** A nice gentle rock back and forth. */
const rockBackAndForth = Action.repeatForever(
  Action.group([
    Action.sequence([
      Action.moveByX(5, 0.33).easeOut(),
      Action.moveByX(-10, 0.34).easeInOut(),
      Action.moveByX(5, 0.33).easeIn(),
    ]),
    Action.sequence([
      Action.rotateByDegrees(-2, 0.33).easeOut(),
      Action.rotateByDegrees(4, 0.34).easeInOut(),
      Action.rotateByDegrees(-2, 0.33).easeIn(),
    ]),
  ])
);

// Run it over here
someSprite.run(rockBackAndForth);

// Run it somewhere else
someOtherContainer.run(rockBackAndForth);
```

You can combine these with dynamic actions for more variety:

```ts
const MyActions = {
  squash: (amount: number, duration: number = 0.3) => Action.sequence([
    Action.scaleTo(amount, 1 / amount, duration / 2).easeOut(),
    Action.scaleTo(1, duration / 2).easeIn()
  ]),
  stretch: (amount: number, duration: number = 0.3) => Action.sequence([
    Action.scaleTo(1 / amount, amount, duration / 2).easeOut(),
    Action.scaleTo(1, duration / 2).easeIn()
  ]),
  squashAndStretch: (amount: number, duration: number = 0.3) => Action.sequence([
    MyActions.squash(amount, duration / 2),
    MyActions.stretch(amount, duration / 2),
  ]),
};

// Small squish!
mySprite.run(MyActions.squashAndStretch(1.25));

// Big squish!
mySprite.run(MyActions.squashAndStretch(2.0));
```

## Running Actions on DisplayObjects

*Running actions in your canvas.*

```ts
// Hide me instantly!
mySprite.run(Action.hide(), () => {
  console.log('where did I go?');
});
```

Display objects are extended with a few new methods and properties to make it easy to interact with actions.

| Property | Description |
| :----- | :------ |
| `speed` | A speed modifier applied to all actions executed by the node and its descendants. Defaults to `1.0`. |
| `isPaused` | A boolean value that determines whether actions on the node and its descendants are processed. Defaults to `false`. |

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :------ |
| `run(action)` | Run an action. |
| `run(action, completion)` | Run an action with a completion handler. |
| `runWithKey(action, withKey)` | Run an action, and store it so it can be retrieved later. |
| `runAsPromise(action): Promise<void>` | Run an action as a promise. |
| `action(forKey): Action \| undefined` | Return an action associated with a specified key. |
| `hasActions(): boolean` | Return a boolean indicating whether the node is executing actions. |
| `removeAllActions(): void` | End and removes all actions from the node. |
| `removeAction(forKey): void` | Remove an action associated with a specified key. |

### Running actions

```ts
// Repeat an action forever!
const spin = Action.repeatForever(Action.rotateBy(5, 1.0));
mySprite.runWithKey(spin, 'spinForever');

// Or remove it later.
mySprite.removeAction('spinForever');
```

### Pausing

```ts
mySprite.isPaused = true;
// All actions will stop running.
```

### Manipulating speed

Speed can be manipulated on both display objects, and actions themselves.

```ts
const moveAction = Action.moveByX(10, 4.0);
moveAction.speed = 2.0;
// moveAction will now take only 2 seconds instead of 4.

const repeatAction = Action.repeat(moveAction, 5);
repeatAction.speed = 2.0;
// Each moveAction will only take 1 second, for a total of 5 seconds.

mySprite.run(moveAction);
mySprite.speed = 2.0;
// mySprite is running at 2x speed!
// The entire action should now take 2.5 seconds.

mySprite.parent.speed = 1 / 4;
// Now we've slowed down mySprite's parent.
// The entire action should now take 10 seconds.
```

> Note: Since actions are designed to be stateless, the `speed` property is captured when the action runs. Any changes to `speed` or `timingMode` will not affect animations that have already been run.

## Creating Custom Actions

Beyond combining chaining actions like `sequence()`, `group()`, `repeat()` and `repeatForever()`, you can provide code that implements your own action.

### Action.customAction()

You can use the built-in `Action.customAction(duration, stepHandler)` to provide custom actions:

```ts
const rainbowColors = Action.customAction(5.0, (target, t, dt) => {
  // Calculate color based on time "t".
  const colorR = Math.sin(0.3 * t + 0) * 127 + 128;
  const colorG = Math.sin(0.3 * t + 2) * 127 + 128;
  const colorB = Math.sin(0.3 * t + 4) * 127 + 128;

  // Apply random color with time-based variation.
  target.tint = (colorR << 16) + (colorG << 8) + colorB;
});

// Start rainbow effect
mySprite.runWithKey(Action.repeatForever(rainbowColors), 'rainbow');

// Stop rainbow effect
mySprite.removeAction('rainbow');
```

> **Step functions:**
> - `target` = The display object.
> - `t` = Progress of time from 0 to 1, which has been passed through the `timingMode` function.
> - `dt` = delta/change in `t` since last step. Use for relative actions.
>
> _Note: `t` can be outside of 0 and 1 in timing mode functions which overshoot, such as `TimingMode.easeInOutBack`._

This function will be called as many times as the renderer asks over the course of its duration.
